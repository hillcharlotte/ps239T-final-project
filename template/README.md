## Short Description

This project attempts to answer how the occupations of campaign donors shifted after implementation of Seattleâ€™s voucher-based campaign finance system. 

1. Are certain occupational groups (e.g. certain business interests, labor, etc.) more or less represented among the donor pool now versus in previous comparable elections? 

2. Looking at the 2017 election specifically, were the occupations of voucher donors systematically different from those who contributed using their own "real" money?

I answer these questions by sorting donors into occupational categories, running a series of statistical tests, and creating relevant visualizations.

## Dependencies

My code depends on the following software: 

1. R 3.4.0, GUI 1.70, El Capitan build
